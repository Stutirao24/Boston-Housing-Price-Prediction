#  Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project implements **Linear Regression** and other ML models to predict the **median value of houses (MEDV)** in Boston suburbs based on various socio-economic and geographical factors.  

---

##  Objective
The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices using features like crime rate, average number of rooms, pollution levels, and accessibility to highways.  

---

##  Dataset
- **Source:** [Boston Housing Dataset (OpenML)](https://www.openml.org/d/531)  
- **Instances:** 506  
- **Features:** 13 predictive variables  
- **Target Variable:** `MEDV` â†’ Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000â€™s  

### Features:
- `CRIM` â€“ per capita crime rate by town  
- `ZN` â€“ proportion of residential land zoned for large lots  
- `INDUS` â€“ proportion of non-retail business acres  
- `CHAS` â€“ Charles River dummy variable  
- `NOX` â€“ nitric oxides concentration  
- `RM` â€“ average number of rooms per dwelling  
- `AGE` â€“ proportion of old houses  
- `DIS` â€“ distance to employment centres  
- `RAD` â€“ accessibility to highways  
- `TAX` â€“ property tax rate  
- `PTRATIO` â€“ pupil-teacher ratio  
- `B` â€“ proportion of Black residents  
- `LSTAT` â€“ % lower status population

##  Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Train-test split (80%-20%)  
   - Standardization using `StandardScaler`  

2. **Models Used**
   - Linear Regression  
   - Ridge Regression  
   - Lasso Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor (for comparison)  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - RÂ² Score  

---

##  Results

### Linear Regression:
- MSE: ~21.9  
- RMSE: ~4.68  
- MAE: ~3.3  
- RÂ²: ~0.73  

### Random Forest (best performance):
- RÂ²: >0.85  

### Key Features:
- ðŸ”¼ `RM` (average rooms) increases house price  
- ðŸ”½ `LSTAT` (% lower status population) decreases house price  
- `DIS` and `NOX` also negatively impact house prices

##  Visualizations
- **Actual vs Predicted** scatter plot  
- **Residuals vs Predicted** plot  
- **Feature Importance Barplot**  

---

##  Conclusion
- Linear Regression provides a strong baseline model.  
- Random Forest achieves the best performance (RÂ² > 0.85).  
- `RM` and `LSTAT` are the most influential predictors of house prices.
